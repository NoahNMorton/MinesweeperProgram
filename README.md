# MinesweeperProgram
A program recreating the famous game, minesweeper in java.

##Program arguments
Arguments can be provided to automatically select the rows and columns and mines of the game, for quick testing purposes. However, the rules for board size still apply. I have not tested it for anything higher than 20 rows/columns and less than 10 rows/columns.

##Running
The jar is executable, although it will need to be ran in a terminal, as it requires arguments or user input to launch. 

###Images
Images are non-copyrighted and free for use. Images can be found in the resource folder, which must be in the same directory as the jar.
